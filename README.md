# Andy's Generic Portfolio Repo
### So many private repos...
I've been needing to do this for so long. Throughout my many educational adventures, I've practiced and implemented a myriad of programming techniques and tricks, but they were all in private repos for that school!

I was just so comfortable with making my code private so no one would pick apart the silly coding failures I'm afraid to admit. 

However, it's come to my attention lately, that I don't have a lot to show off. So I've decided to make a public sandbox to act as my portfolio, where I'll just put a bunch of public code here.
### Website: The Game
So the main reason of making this repo public was to use github's hosting service to showcase my random ideas and WIPs as I build my portfolio website as a game without any scripting.

HTML and CSS only!

Be sure you're viewing the webpage here: [https://Ansem717.github.io](https://Ansem717.github.io){:target="_blank"}
It should just be showing this Markdown file, but this way you're on the actual *.io page*.

As I mentioned, Website: The Game acts as a CSS sandbox. I would follow some articles or youtube videos and make some concept come to life. Sometimes an idea doesn't have a design inspiration or I end up ~~overscoping~~ thinking bigger and want to start a new project.

Without further ado:
